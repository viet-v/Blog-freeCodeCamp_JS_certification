                Today January 12, 2022<br>
                About 6:30 PM
            </span><br>
            I just completed the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course of freeCodeCamp.<br>
            One word to describe my feeling? Amazing!<br>
            Why? Because I was stuck in 2 headachy last projects: Telephone Number Validator & Cash Register. And I solved them by myself!</p>

        <p>    
            Of course there was time that I wanted to take a hint from solution page, but to my surprise, there is no solution for these projects! That makes sense, because no challenge only has one solution. So, it was a great motivation for me to try harder.<br>
        </p>

        <h2>How I dealed with the Telephone Number Validator challenge</h2>
        <p class="question">Here's the question<br>
            Return true if the passed string looks like a valid US phone number.
            <br><br>
            The user may fill out the form field any way they choose as long as it has the format of a valid US number. The following are examples of valid formats for US numbers (refer to the tests below for other variants):
            <br><br>
            555-555-5555<br>
            (555)555-5555<br>
            (555) 555-5555<br>
            555 555 5555<br>
            5555555555<br>
            1 555 555 5555<br><br>
            For this challenge you will be presented with a string such as 800-692-7753 or 8oo-six427676;laskdjf. Your job is to validate or reject the US phone number based on any combination of the formats provided above. The area code is required. If the country code is provided, you must confirm that the country code is 1. <br>
            Return true if the string is a valid US phone number; otherwise return false.</p>

            <summary>And here is my code</summary>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    function telephoneCheck(str) {
                        const regex1 = /(?&lt;!\()1?\s*\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}/
                    // 2 hyphens, no beginning with (, has one or zero number 1 at beginning
                    
                        const regex2 = /^1\s*\(\d{3}\)\s*\d{3}-\d{4}/
                    // 1 hyphen, number 1 (country code) must be at beginning, first 3 numbers surrounded by parentheses
                    
                        const regex3 = /^\(\d{3}\)\s*\d{3}-\d{4}/
                    // 1 hyphen, no country code, first 3 numbers surrounded by parentheses
                    
                        const regex4 = /^1\s*\d{3}\s*\d{3}\s*\d{4}/
                    // 0 hyphen, 1 (country code) at beginning, followed by 10 numbers
                    
                        const regex5 = /\d{3}\s*\d{3}\s*\d{4}(?!\))/
                    // 0 hyphen, no country code, 10 numbers, no parentheses at the end
                    // this case has to combine with condition str.length === 10, because any string with 11 numbers or more could also match
                    
                    //  console.log('27576227382'.match(regex4))
                    
                        if (str.match(regex1) || str.match(regex2) ||
                            str.match(regex3) ||
                            str.match(regex4)){
                        return true;
                        } else if (str.match(regex5) && str.length === 10) {
                        return true;
                        } 
                        return false;
                        
                    }

        <p>At first I looked at the question and had no idea what I was gonna do with it, nothing came out of my mind. Of course it would not be that fast, they already said these challenges are ‚Äúmuch more difficult‚Äù üòñ than the intermediate algorithm challenges, which I found not so easy.<br>
            After analyzing the test, I realized they have some commonalities, I can check each condition by regular expression (a mighty tool).</p>
        <p class="explain">
            For example, with number <code>555-555-5555</code> & <code>1 555-555-5555</code><br>
            I used <code>regex1 = /(?&lt;!\()1?\s*\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}/</code> (arrr headachy right?). With this regex I make sure the numbers that have 2 hyphens between 3 digits, 3 digits & 4 digits, maybe have number 1 at beginning (country code), and no parentheses at the very beginning are valid.<br>
            So in this case this number won‚Äôt pass <code>(555-555-5555</code>
        </p>
        <p>Just like that, I created 5 regular expressions in total.</p>
        <p class="explain">
            It was pretty smooth until I met the trickiest part of this solution.<br>
            <code>regex5 = /\d{3}\s*\d{3}\s*\d{4}(?!\))/</code><br>
            <b>5555555555</b> (10 digits) this number can pass this regex, and so does this <b>27576227382</b> (11 digits), because I used match() method.<br>
            Now I can easily explain it, but at first it was so frustrating that the later one can pass the regex (if it has 11 digits, the first digit must be 1, not 2). Then if I change the regex, the first one <b>5555555555</b> won‚Äôt pass! üòµ<br>
            So briefly, at last I prioritized this last regex, I said <code>if (str.match(regex5) && str.length === 10)</code> Yep! Had to force the length to 10. And woo hoo! Passed the challenge!
        </p>
        <p>I know the way I solve is very manual, it‚Äôs not so concise and smart, but I‚Äôm very happy with it because I found my own unique way.</p>

        <h2>That was the morning, in the afternoon I met the boss - Cash Register üí™</h2>
        <p class="question">Here's the question<br>
            Design a cash register drawer function checkCashRegister() that accepts purchase price as the first argument (price), payment as the second argument (cash), and cash-in-drawer (cid) as the third argument.<br>
            cid is a 2D array listing available currency.<br>
            The checkCashRegister() function should always return an object with a status key and a change key.<br>
            Return {status: "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS", change: []} if cash-in-drawer is less than the change due, or if you cannot return the exact change.<br>
            Return {status: "CLOSED", change: [...]} with cash-in-drawer as the value for the key change if it is equal to the change due.<br>
            Otherwise, return {status: "OPEN", change: [...]}, with the change due in coins and bills, sorted in highest to lowest order, as the value of the change key.<br>
            <br>
            Currency Unit	Amount<br>
            Penny	$0.01 (PENNY)<br>
            Nickel	$0.05 (NICKEL)<br>
            Dime	$0.1 (DIME)<br>
            Quarter	$0.25 (QUARTER)<br>
            Dollar	$1 (ONE)<br>
            Five Dollars	$5 (FIVE)<br>
            Ten Dollars	$10 (TEN)<br>
            Twenty Dollars	$20 (TWENTY)<br>
            One-hundred Dollars	$100 (ONE HUNDRED)<br>
            See below for an example of a cash-in-drawer array:<br>
            <br>
            [<br>
              ["PENNY", 1.01],<br>
              ["NICKEL", 2.05],<br>
              ["DIME", 3.1],<br>
              ["QUARTER", 4.25],<br>
              ["ONE", 90],<br>
              ["FIVE", 55],<br>

        <p>If when I saw Telephone Number Validator I had no solution at first, this time I had no idea what I was looking at. Man I didn‚Äôt even understand the question! Haha!<br>
            But I said I got this, I had this situation many times, just get cool and keep reading, then read again, read the test kit.<br>
            After understanding the question, it took me a bit of time to figure out the algorithm. My solution can be explained like this.</p>
        <p class="explain">
            Find the <i>change = cash - price</i><br>
            Subtract the <i>change</i> to the biggest amount of a certain currency unit which is smaller than the <i>change</i>. For example, <i>change</i> subtracts 60 at first (the 3rd test).<br>
            Keep subtracting until <i>change</i> is no longer greater than or equal to the next amount. Then I subtract <i>change</i> to the currency unit value itself (by referring to my currency array with respective index with <i>cid</i> array)<br>
            And keep doing until <i>change === 0</i><br>
            <br>
            That‚Äôs the first condition when <i>change</i> is less than cash-in-drawer, but if cash-in-drawer can‚Äôt return the exact <i>change</i> (means <i>change</i> at the end !== 0) because they don‚Äôt have the needed bills, the output would be different.<br>
            Second condition is when <i>change</i> is greater than cash-in-drawer, this one is simple, just print ‚ÄúINSUFFICIENT_FUNDS‚Äù.<br>
            And the last condition is when <i>change</i> is equal to cash-in-drawer.<br>
            That‚Äôs the main idea, plus fixing some problems with decimal values.
        </p>
        <p>Sometimes I couldn‚Äôt get it, why it doesn‚Äôt work while everything makes sense, is there any problems with my browser or this challenge setup?? Haha I know it sounds ridiculous. There were many times I thought that, and of course it was always my problem.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Keep calm and draw the picture, the damn bug is hiding somewhere. Check the hierarchy, specially when there‚Äôre so many {} nested inside each other. Put the code at the right place, everything would be smoothhh!</p>

        <br>
        <p>That‚Äôs it! So lengthy but this is officially my first learning blog. The idea came to me when I was wandering back and forth to find solution for the boss challenge. I should have done this earlier. Learning to code is an interesting journey!</p>
